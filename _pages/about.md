Hello there!

Welcome to my personal site.


My name is **Aryan**, and I'm an **ML/AI scientist** with over 13 years of experience, having led and contributed to advanced AI projects at **Amazon**, **Siemens**, and **Ambarella**. I specialize in **Computer Vision**, **Generative AI**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **deep learning model optimization**.

Over the years, my work has spanned various industries, including **perception systems for autonomous vehicles**, **AI-powered retail automation**, and **healthcare AI**.

Currently, I’m an **Applied Scientist** on the **Research & Reasoning team** at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/author/aryan-mobiny">Amazon</a>, based in Palo Alto, California, where I develop state-of-the-art generative AI and computer vision systems. My focus is on enhancing user experience, optimizing system performance, and driving revenue growth.

I hold a Ph.D. from the **University of Houston**, where I was a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.hvnguyen.com/">HULA Lab</a> and a fellow at the Center for Advanced Computing and Data Science (CACDS). My doctoral research focused on machine learning applications in computer vision—particularly under low-label and imperfect data conditions.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
