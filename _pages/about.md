I am Aryan, a Senior Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer in Ambarella's algorithm team, 
based in Santa Clara, California. I design and implement computer vision algorithms 
needed for autonomous driving capability , such as video object segmentation and detection,
multi-object tracking, multi-sensor fusion. Previously, I interned at SIEMENS and EigenControl
and worked on different machine learning projects.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Houston in 2020 where I worked as a research
assistant at HULA Lab and fellow at the Center for Advanced Computing and Data Science (CACDS).
My research was mainly focused on Machine Learning and its applications in Computer Vision and
Medical Image Processing with less label and imperfect data.

I’m interested in various inference methods, neural network architectures including attention
and memory, and in everything that can be described as “machine reasoning”. I've also worked
on several open source and cool side projects (find them at the bottom of this page). I
am always looking for exciting research and professional opportunities, so feel free to get
in touch. To find more information about my research topics and other experiences, see my Resume.
